    title: "Scale your apps with Azure Keda"
    subtitle: "Event-driven architectures are a natural evolution of Microservices, enabling a flexible and decoupled design, and are increasingly being adopted by enterprise customers. Scaling in Kubernetes is reactive, based on the CPU and memory consumption of a container. In contrast, services like Azure Functions are acutely aware of event sources and therefore able to scale based on signals coming directly from the event source, even before the CPU or memory is impacted. So We need to bring the benefits of event-driven architectures and the productivity of functions to Kubernetes. The result is KEDA – Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling. Microsoft and Red Hat partnered to build this open-source component to provide event-driven capabilities for any Kubernetes workload. KEDA enables any container to scale from zero to potentially thousands of instances based on event metrics like the length of a Kafka stream or an Azure Queue. It also enables containers to consume events directly from the event source instead of decoupling with HTTP. KEDA can drive the scale of any container and is extensible to add new event sources. It is in GA now with 1.0 release."

    title: "DAPR - Microservices building block for Cloud"
    subtitle: "Dapr is an open-source, portable, event-driven runtime that makes it easy for developers to build resilient, microservice stateless and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge. Dapr embraces the diversity of all programming languages and developer frameworks and simplifies building applications such as the e-commerce example.
    Dapr consists of a set of building blocks accessed by standard HTTP or gRPC APIs that can be called from any programming language. These building blocks empower all developers with proven, industry best practices and each building block is independent; you can use one, some, or all of them in your applications"
